                <b>Preface</b>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                One blurry summer, the events of which will forever be a drop of mercury spilling from ear to ear, I became acquainted with a group that I will call the Backwater Saints. This is not they’re real name and neither are the names of the characters in the following story. In fact, I have even changed their species. This is for the safety of everyone involved in these events, including and especially, me. Not that I have done anything illegal, per se, but these people are not ones whose bad side I would ever want to be on. The backwater Saints are a group, they could even be called a collective, which dwell in the murky underbelly of San Diego. I am convinced that there are backwater saints in other cities as well, just in different forms. If you ever come across these backwater-type people, it means you’ve spent too long in that town. Start planning on leaving as soon as you can.

                I have moved beyond the palm trees, here in San Diego. I moved on, down down the rabbit hole to the natural shrubbery where I now lay in and make dirty coitus. The grassy beds have been replaced by the thin layers of grainy which quickly wash over you like a dusty river. Eyes always blinking, whether from sunlight or sand, you’re not supposed to see straight here.

                <b>At the Baba Yaga</b>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                He walked in with shoes shining like Plexiglas monitors into the Baba Yaga. It was a bar, semi-hip. He came to meet a new acquaintance. He walked in and spotted a sluggish figure with two lady-specimens by his side. The bar was inhabited by the degenerates of the night, most with stained drooling on their shirts and acid burns on their forearms. His slug friend, Dono, hadn’t seen him yet, so he thought he’d take the time to walk around and stare at the filth for a little while. He needed to calm his nerves. There were drugs served to them in manufactured crystal vases, not what you’d call classy but the sleepy one always thought the clear and cut was like a chandelier at a country club. Swine with fragile art on their hoofs, that’s what he thought.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                He finally approached Dono, greeting him and the two helpless ones with a half-hearted wave. He couldn’t help but notice Dono’s slime staining the cloth on both of the little ones. The victim that was to be his companion for the night was named Scylla, while Dono’s was Asha. They savored their first bite of each other, their initial flavors, and ordered a round of stingy marmalade. He smelled something foul. He was sure it wasn’t him. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Sipping on their marmalade, taking little nibbles at each other, there was a sudden blaring of trumpets coagulating with dissonant triangle rhythms. The avant-garde arrangement was matched by howls and spooks around the bar, guttural leaps of voice box delirium and high-high la-la-arama. The holes wanted a jitter down on the floor, pulling on their master’s hind sleeves.  He knew a jitter or two that he practiced in the comfort of his own peace, so he wasn’t too herky at the proposition. He took to the floor with his shufflefoot, jaja 23-skidoo next to him. Their legs were a flurry of colorful concavity. His had a bashful tinge and the poor soul’s had a bashless excitement. So much so that they mouthed along:

            <p><i>
                Jigga-jigga he he
            </i></p>
            <br/>
            <p><i>
                Lastwana hither me
            </i></p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <i>To you-you love</i>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <i>Swapped in sight</i>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <i>Lost with mighty</i>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <i>Reverence for a gifted lady</i>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                <i>Etc. </i>
            </p>

                He was able to match the deer’s headlight freakout jitter reasonably swell. Dono kept it cool and simple with a vibrated ligament on maple. They kept their play for some songs and limped back with shaky leg syndrome to the bar. More sticky marmelags, on Dono. His generosity, his home, his peace.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Dono knew the Baba Yaga well. The drinks here were casted charm spells, solicited concoctions of black magic. Dono came from a family of Salem witches, his history mad him a commodity and a treasure. Dono had the way of someone with close ties to the under-foot. Dono had the way of someone who knew that they couldn’t be touched.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                With a harmless smile, Dono spoke words of reassurance to the two rabbit. Soon they were all taking a stroll to Dono’s place, the Skelton Room. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                The scene: two cowboys out on the range, two little rabbits have crossed into their domain. Dono was not shy about showing off his hollow-point 22. They are most effective against live game. The cowboys stared down the arid pathway, into the musky fur of their prey. Their rifles raise and polished him and Dono, they watch the little ones at home, trying their best to run and skip. They know they have it in the bag, so they savor the moment, this moment where they are the creators of these rabbits’ fate. They move in closer. His sweat carrying his grime down from his brow to his eyes. Dry, alky-smelling, mouth and rough skin, tip-toeing over through dry weeds and yellow floating dust. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Both handlers took their victims for a bit. He watched Dono closely, for guidance. Dono was spitting up venom phlegm. The victims made pathetic sounds while stroking our ego. His fingers ran through hair which felt like ashen wood carved stilettos. Dono grabbed a handful, his palm grazing fragile collar bone of the captive. In the two prey’s minds there is a chemical conflux of confusion. They recognize the downed, slugged melody of biological progression. Statues were erected, and the mood soured him but he did not call may-day. He knew the protocol for an infiltrated mind. In moments his own pet was bound and bent in savage force, taking repression, being the exorciser. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                From Dono’s end there was silence. From his quick glance over he saw the victim paralyzed in fearful ecstasy as Dono drained her life-essence. He caught Dono’s look of deep satisfaction, of sexual gluttony.

                As the stalkers slept in victory over their prey, the Baba Yaga kept its lively romp until the early morning. The establishment was up on mighty pretense, bringing the lighthearted fad-children, so unaware of the depravity that keeps its doors open. They have chickens in there running around only seeing axe-handles, but no axe. Bag-of-bones knocking themselves out and crashing on marble top counterfeit dollars. Spider webs line the cracks in the bathrooms and the enchanting aroma of slug juice creeps up through the floor boards. The electricity runs and tumbles on air and moist skin and glands. The Baba Yaga is where the young and foolish become the old and irresponsible. It is a place of pubic agreement and maturity.

                There was a stench that permeated the apartment door. He was here to pick up with Skhada the body humidifiers for the eon retreat. Skhada knew the Marty from his connections at the Baba and this was the first time he finally took them up on their offers. The two waited, both not knowing Marty from a hole in the wall. Eventually, the two opened the door. It was unlocked. 
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                They found a body. At least, that’s what they assumed it was, as half of it was covered and glued to the floor by what looked like a deep crimson tar. The stench washed over them like a wetting fog at pier, their hair becoming moist with disgussion. The body was completely still. Judging by the smell, the two nomads figured the body must have been lying there for days. They called Dono who came and brought some over to take the body. They had troubled lifting the body at first, as it was damn near cemented to the floor by the dried blood. When they finally forced the body off the ground, the dried tar broke and let loose big drippings of uriny rusted iron onto the already stained carpet. Marty’s one eye that wasn’t covered showed grey cloudy delight.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                There was no effort to conceal the body or what was being done. The body was hurriedly carried through the corridors of the apartment complex. No one came out of their rooms to see what the noise or the stench was about. We didn’t hear from anybody, not the tenants or the landlord. Marty’s body was carried into an unmarked and driven to god-knows-where.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                The funeral was held at the backyard swamp, compliments of Dono and the Yaga. All the saints were there, glasses brimming with wine. There was no casket, only a hole dug out on the marsh. It didn’t take long for the body to get infested with the termites of the dead and dying but nobody seemed to mind. One by one we all walked to the body, said our prayer, and poured what was left of our infused wine on the pointless martyr – while the priest sang his eulogy:

                <b>Eulogy from the Lips of Lamb</b>

            <p>
                For this I thank thee, the Lord and baby triad. I thank you for will of which I have no control. I thank you for my eyes which see mirage and falsity. I thank you for my ears which hear helpless screams. I thank you for my mouth which tastes my salty sin on my skin. I thank you for the chemicals which secrete into our brains. I thank you for planting the seeds of perversion and depravity in my youth. I thank you for the ropes and belts which I use to bound and gag myself. I thank you for pain which lets me know that, yes, I am alive. I thank you for love, the place where the grass is always greener. I thank you for blood and sweet fruit nectar which allows the feeding of land. I thank you for atomic precision and circumstance. I thank you for a neglecting family, which allows me to be who I am without care. I thank you for madness and its random energy. I thank you for my two legs, which give me the illusion of progression. I thank you for my sense of touch so that I may feel your absence. I thank you with all my heart for this life which makes me wish for less. I thank you for scorching truth of sunlight and the trickery of moonlight. I thank you for making this my grave from which I will return – for making this my ship, my canoe, back across samsara.
