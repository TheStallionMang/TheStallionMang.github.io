                Gotama clamped himself down on his hands and feet, black dirt on his palms, and barked at the pedestrians. His asscrack was showing and his eyes were out of their sockets. He would sometimes spot a cockroach and he would gallop to it and sniff. Slobber would spill out of his mouth as he barked with the other dogs and chase tails.

                He knows a tree somewhere off central, and circles it and curls up at its trunk. He’s been here countless times, collecting shade on these hot summer days, dreaming and imagining himself as a series of lines, then a series of points floating around in different combinations to make different forms. Gotama dreams:

                The wheels of his cart would roll over the cracks in the floor at even intervals. It sounded a rhythm in his head. Soon the lights were flashing on and off in sync with this rhythm. The moans of the other loonies would come through their bins. It was like a choir assault on his brain. He struggled and struggled, he tried to make all the noise that he could, but nothing came out, no sound or movement. The only thing he managed to do was sweat.

                He usually only smokes ciggys when he’s drunk but, on this occasion, it was after a classic fuck. It was his first time with a hooker, a chick with a fat ass, he never thought he’d get to fuck a ass like she had. The air was activating sweat on his face, he was like a copper coil flipping electromagnetic. Stray cats ran across and stray cats would fuck for their lives and he felt the rumblings of the cockroaches under the city as they fucked too and now he felt like he was natures dirty work, except not really because the whore required he wear a condom, even for his blowey joey. She was also against kissing. Why did he want to kiss a hooker, anyhow? Do cockroaches even fuck? When the whore lifted her dress, he immediately noticed her lasagna looking birth scars. She had mentioned her children but goddamn it why do whores always feel the need to tell him that.

                And so, he would awake, drenched and take stock of his white surroundings. He was always cold and sweating. Like usual he got up before his roommate, who never comes out of the room.

                Her pink lipstick rubbed off on her scarred arms as she lapped up the blood running down her wrist. Tears of regret had stained her face and she was feeling light-headed. She could barely find the strength to lift her upper body.

                The room was like a blank sheet of paper with humans collaged onto it. He and a group of other normal looking people are conversing at a bargain grey table. The setting is like the beginning of a joke; “Two Jews walk into a bar and get strapped down and lobotomized because it’s not really a bar, it’s actually a funny farm that is oddly inhabited by a lot of white people.”

                As her eyes wandered around the bathroom, all of her cosmetic accessories took the form of all the men that climbed into her. Her hair straightener looked like the exotic Puerto Rican who came up on her at the café; her blow dryer looked like her prom date with whom she spent a sloppy night in a cheap hotel. Her bathroom had turned into an overflowing jar of faces.

                His nurses had given him some anxiety medication because he was having a bad day but they didn’t do anything to rid him of the anxiety, they just made him feel groggy and slow like he had to have his mouth slightly open always. He sat across the table from the obese meth-addict who was eating a salad, which he found interesting because the guy was fat and eating a salad, but the meth-head breathed really hard and he noticed the saliva dripping from his top teeth to the bottom teeth and he noticed the addicts slow groggy movements and dropped eyes and oh god he couldn’t help but feel like he was only a miniature version of this fat fuck.

                She was confused as to why they were all here and her lips moved to ask them, but they would just look on, satisfied. Her hand slips on the edge of the tub and smacks on her elbow. She uses all her willpower to get up out of the water, which now has a dancing red mist.

                His absent-minded walking brought him to a high school, where apparently a couple of kids had been stabbed. The whore had a special, she only charged 100 dollars for a half hour which he thought would be too short but it ended up being a lot longer than he thought and he was exhausted by the end of it.

                Her pink lipstick matches her pink tongue.

                He was now walking the white halls, back and forth, limping, not that his leg was hurting but he just couldn’t help it, he was looking for his love, he was looking for a window, a way out. Faintly, he remembered the meditation practice that the nurses taught him. Get comfortable. He walked slowly in tight circles. Imagine a forest landscape, or maybe a mountain or an ocean. Walking on a rural trail he spots his cabin in the distance and the lights are on what are the lights doing on he built that cabin and now other people are using it, well if he can’t using nobody can and runs up to it in a frenzy and tries to start a fire, start, c’mon, start, and finally it’s going and it’s slowly making its way eating the shitty wood cabin and he can hear screams inside and two people run out, he grabs the axe he used to gather the wood and runs after them, they’re running hand in hand towards the lake and when he finally catches up to them he swings it into the man’s spine and the woman is screaming, begging him to stop, but he keeps swinging separating the man’s vertebrae from the rest of his body and the woman drops to her knees and holds the man’s head sobbing like a goddamn baby, just like him, he’s crying tears of joy and sadness, he’d never been so fulfilled, the fire at this point has spread through the whole forest and the smoke was going into his lungs and it was making it hard to see what was right in front of him, he relishes in the glimpses of dread on her face and soon the smoke engulfs all and he opens his eyes and he is in his room and his roommate is gone.

                My child is sleeping right now and it’s dark. I am pointing the barrel to where I think his little temple lies, making sure not to touch it so as not to wake him. I miss him already. He’s such a smart little thing. He lit up my whole life. The moment he came out of his mother I rethought everything. I went from wondering when he was going to realize that life is nothing to appreciating what life brings. Magic and wonder which I thought were gone forever have made their way back into my life. I went grocery shopping with him and showed him his first watermelon. His eyes lit up in amazement. He had never seen anything like it in his young life. I gotta do this before I start getting a headache. He revived my marriage. My marriage to the women now lying in our hallway had grown so dense and heavy and dead. I can’t let him go on like this, with no arms to touch the world with, with no legs to explore with. My vision was very much blurred as my finger found its way to the trigger. I can see his hair so much like mine, his skin so much like mine and his mother’s. My eyes have adjusted to the darkness.

                The androgynous woman looked so much so that he knew he could choose for himself. So, he attached himself to her and felt such ecstasy like he hadn’t ever felt. He was melting into her. She had a hard no nonsense look about her and she spoke in such a way as well - she called people ‘cunts’ when she wanted and threw people in her life away when it was necessary, there was no fat in her life, everyone and everything was like a cog in a completely optimized machine. She discarded and apologized both when it was necessary, knowing the perfect distance to keep people. All were drawn to her, but he held on, smiling and indulging but she never ever looked his way. He was in love, and she was indifferent.

                But like everything she fell away. Disappeared. He was left in a room with a blinding light. He just wanted to see his androgynous woman again. Eventually out of the blinding light came three figures. One was another androgynous woman only she was very plantlike. One looked like a short fat satyr with a horseshoe bald head. The last one was the androgynous woman he longed for. They said incomprehensible things and the blinding light enveloped all. When the light left, he saw himself and everyone around him had turned into breast-like plants. They all laughed and laughed hysterically. They laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and they laughed and everything was green and pink and he reflected on his past life in comparison to the one he has now where all he can do is laugh and realized how much better his life is now.

                ‘I understand the lust for murder. Blood is a magnificent shade that increases a moment’s aesthetic value. The color of blood, the color of a circulatory system, the hue of muscle tissue, the whiteness of bone. The synergy of color and sound is like what I imagine it would be like to walk through Tokyo at night. Beautiful neon in tandem with the glowing powerful moon. The expression of a face without skin is truly marvelous. It seems to convey every possible emotion at once.. Horror, ecstasy, wonderment, shock, sadness..’

                I swallow all of the cosmic regret. I swallow the putrefaction of every planet of every galaxy. The wailing of mothers and the tears of fathers fill my belly. The collective sadness mixes with the collective unconscious into a sweet drink that I piss out. The wonderful endless strife is what I swallow and then shit out on to all material things. Each prayer is stored and left decaying, ripening, until the fruits of despair are at its sweetest. The pangs of longing, of loss, of hunger, of wistfulness are my seeds which grow in every organism who will bear the sweet fruit of my consumption and never ending appetite. The universe is perfect.

                So, this is my new lord to whom this fine kingdom has been bequeathed, unyet betrothed to and bewitched by the fair richness of luxur. Hark! Gracious now, until sedation, or perhaps detrition by sedition? Sayth, the commoner: the 10 days of the new lord, ad mors ad infinitum. Hark, I! The soul of the commoner stays constant - calloused, wrinkled, and sun-dried; the soul of the king, splashed by the fountain of youth and swallowed by lethe, bound to the same lessons. Again, sayth, ad infinitum. Cometh the day when your heart is ensnared by a lute melody - dare I say that these are the beginnings of the betrothment? Haush! Quoth, thethed, your literate mind - I, his majesty’s smile, would not know if tomorrow I had woken up in the Orient! Thou art sure that your ears have harkened, that your lobes have thickened and elongated like a sponge, but hark! For you will wake up to find your eyes have been scrubbed clean, and the Sisyphean task begins anew - whether you, majesty, or the peasant is Sisyphus I do not know!

                I entered my home as the lights were off. I was letting my friend sleep on my couch. I called out. ‘Hello!?’ They said ‘Keep the light off, yes I’m here.’ My finger was on the switch. I hesitated, I didn’t know what I was going to see if I switched it on. ‘..why?’ ‘Keep it off..’
