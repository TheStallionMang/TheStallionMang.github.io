                Afoot and ashen, the Gotama, with photovoltaic energy,  relevés again, synthesizing rogue glares, tracing the runes of modernity on the passerby orange-line trolley, a holler-at-me beggar’s scraped choke collar, cataracted eyes like a knight riding to manifest destiny betraying a secret graveness.

            <br/>

                …the distilling experiences, his open mind a caressing harbor that says ‘I know where you’ve been, now rest well.’

                The days were a slight pink blur. Whirling colors and distorted music, the echoing sound of feet and shifted ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs.’ Sometimes it could feel a force spinning it or a prodding stick on its face, which it would try to swat away, thinking it a leering gaze of a lion, which is followed by a roar of shock from the giant many-headed and many-limbed mass.

                Night, however, was populated by the sounds of howling wolves and roaring mountain lions that were ever present and vague apparitions, sometimes appearing within the cell, of hungry, leering, animals with fangs would activate its adrenal glands. It feels a constant threat on its life and cannot run. Years of over feeding had turned most of its muscle to fat, and so it sits there, fearful of shadows, unable to sleep. These apparitions would, at times, appear to it during the day and it would attempt a very loud intimidating roar, providing a thrill to its spectators as its quickly followed by mirthful chatter and laughter as they watch it catch its short breath and fail to use its useless legs to stand – fail to even cower at the crowd.

                It was my birthday slumber party and so I had a number of my friends, acquaintances, and peers at my residence. A night of amusement and thoughtless mockery. First, unfortunate for those in the room who are fond of analytic philosophy, was a taunting confutation of the basic tenets of positivism. Those peers who rather revere the analytic approach to philosophy were rather peeved. So, we then switched to doing a sort of improvised play – a biting satire of the old southern aristocracy, you could say it was a nod and a wink to the likes of Tennessee Williams (of course we could not improvise the magnificence of his work and nor does this matter because my slumber parties are the best at my school). My father, wonderful chaperone that he is, suggested we break from our games and gave us some snacks (exquisite cheese and crackers). We very much obliged. After that we decided to play one more game before our slumber. This game was much more free form than the previous. We each took turns and simply tested our quick wit. To illustrate this, when it was my turn to be droll, I grabbed myself a toque and pulled it down over my face. I made sure my whole body was covered in clothing, posed as David does in his beautiful sculpture, pulled my genitalia out and said

            <br/>
            <p>
                “censorship”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Thankfully, I immediately heard the sound of my peers reveling at my wit. Up next was one of my close compatriots. When the laughter has subsided, he simply said

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “tire”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                and yawned, arched back into a circle, grabbed his calves and rolled around the room.
            </p>

                A stain was found on his bed sheets one day. Doesn’t matter what he was doing at the time, it only matters that he found it. At first he wondered how it got there. He always liked to keep his room spotless. Is this a pointless detail? He scratched at it and then sniffed. He immediately remembered where it came from. Months ago, he brought a nice girl over and during sex he fingered her asshole and some poop spilled out onto his sheets. He chuckled at himself, as someone who would reminisce about youthful hijinks would.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                He didn’t clean the stain. For months, as he would go about his day, he would glance in the direction of the stain as he walked by his bed, wondering why he had not cleaned it already. Eventually he gave in and smelled it again. The smell was intoxicating. He felt a bliss unlike any before. He started doing it regularly. Sometimes he would sniff and then realize that hours had passed without realizing it. As he sniffed for hours, he would contemplate his life journey. He would think about the friends he’s made, where he came from, and what his goals are.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                He’d take a deep wiff of the poop stain…

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                *wifffff*

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                As he smelled the poop stain and as he ran out of things to contemplate in his own life he started thinking about the future of humanity. Climate refugees as sea levels rise, increase in the frequency of hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons. He thought about the steadily increasing globate temperature. He thought about how during the most catastrophic extinction event the global temperature increased a mere 6 degrees.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                These thoughts would cause a sinking feeling in him and he would try to blur his thoughts. He’d close his eyes and just concentrate on the warm and musk aroma of the poop stain.

            <p>
                At some point a question had made its way into his head. He wondered about the corrosive affects of battery acid. He had seen an interview of a man, a victim of an acid attack, whose face looked smooth and shiny. This wonderment led to the position he is in now – sitting on the floor with a strange girl in his lap and a bucket of acid.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                He rolled her over so that she was facing away from him. He scooped up some acid with a cup and poured some into her ear canal. It didn’t take very long for her to writhe and scream.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “please, tell me what it feels like, okay?”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                He poured some more as she grit her teeth and let out another wail. He couldn’t understand why he was doing this. He wondered where these urges were coming from.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “am I being possessed?”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                The girl began commenting on the burning sensation in her ears. She said it’s like she can feel it in her brain.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “No, that’s too convenient. The real horror is that I’m not really possessed. This is just the way I am. Maybe that’s what a good writer would do? Should I describe your agony better?”
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Her eyes were bloodshot and dripping. She was dripping from her nose as well.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “Sometimes I think… what if I were in your position? And you were in mine? A woman forcibly dripping acid onto an innocent man.”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                She trembled, her eyes rolling up to the back of her head.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “But somehow that doesn’t convey the hopelessness and despair that I want. There’s a kernel of something good in the role reversal, the marginalized woman torturing the patriarchal oppressor, even if he himself hasn’t personally done anything bad…”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                She was desperately trying to chew out of her duct tape.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “…no this situation is better for conveying hopelessness. A person in a more privileged class abusing a lesser privileged one.”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                She could feel a burning sensation behind her eyeballs, bubbling and simmering.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “This is what the world really is. Just different versions of the horror you’re experiencing now.”

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                The ropes that kept her arms tied were beginning to loosen, her shouts of pain becoming less muffled.

            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                “Let’s cut it off here. Let them think you had a chance.”
